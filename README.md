  ▶️ The user will be presented with the homepage which if no workouts have previously been added will only show the choice of "New Workout".  The user can then add exercises with two main types being "Resistance" and "Cardio".   Once the user makes the initial type selection they will be presented with varying fields to fill out.  Resistance allows users to add Name, weight, sets, reps and duration && Cardio allows users to add Name, Distance and duration.  Once these fields have been filled out correctly the user can either chose to "Complete" the workout which means the user will add the current exercise and be redirected to the home page || if they choose "Add Exercises" the user will be able to add another exercise to the workout.  Once workouts have been added a summary of the last workout will appear on the homepage and the user can also so see stats in graphical display by clicking the dashboard link.  Here stats are shown in bar and pie charts of the history of workouts that have been saved.
